With this project we are going to implement a **multilayer perceptron**, in order to predict whether a cancer is malignant or benign on a dataset of breast cancer diagnosis in the Wisconsin. The goal of this project is to give us a first approach to **artificial neural networks**, and to made us implement the algorithms at the heart of the training process.
