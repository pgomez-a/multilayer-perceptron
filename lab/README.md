Before training an artificial neural network, we must first understand what an artificial neural network is. For this reason, I have implemented a modular multilayer perceptron model that will help us understand how a neural network works and how we can use it to diagnose breast cancer. For now, we are going to cover the following scripts:
- **Perceptron.py**
- **LayerPerceptron.py**
- **MultilayerPerceptron.py**
