# Data Analysis
Before implementing our **Machine Learning** model, we must first understand the available data. This is a very important step that we have to take if we want to develop a model that we can fully understand. In fact, to complete this project, we are provided with a dataset with raw data. In the **[/dataset/](https://github.com/pgomez-a/multilayer-perceptron/tree/main/datasets)** folder we can find this dataset called **dataset_raw.csv**.<br>

If we read **dataset_raw.csv**, we see that this file contains a lot of numbers that don't seem to make sense. So our first task is to give this raw data a format that helps us understand the available data. This process is called data cleaning. It consists of reading the **dataset_info.txt** file to understand what each row and each column represents. Once we understand this, we can format our **dataset_raw.csv to dataset_clean.csv**. In our case, this format has been given following the below information:
